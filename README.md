# cucco-copter
You threw a Cuccoâ€”and it came back with motors. Cucco-Copter is a battery-powered quadcopter drone developed by a team of UW students with a shared love of Hyrule and hardware. Designed for stable manual flight, with plans to expand into autonomous modes and aerial data collection. Unlike its namesake, it won't attack you if thrown... probably.
